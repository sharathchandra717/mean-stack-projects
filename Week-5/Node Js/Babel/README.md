# Babel
Babel is a JavaScript compiler  
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
* Transform syntax
* Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through @babel/polyfill)
* Source code transformations (codemods)
* And more! (check out these videos for inspiration)
```
// Babel Input: ES2015 arrow function
[1, 2, 3].map((n) => n + 1);

// Babel Output: ES5 equivalent
[1, 2, 3].map(function(n) {
  return n + 1;
});
```
